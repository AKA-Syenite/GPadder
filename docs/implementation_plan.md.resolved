# Flesh out USB and Gamepad Logging Plan

The goal is to provide deep diagnostic information about connected USB devices and gamepads to help troubleshoot detection issues.

## Proposed Changes

### [GamepadManager]

#### [MODIFY] [GamepadManager.cs](file:///c:/Users/syenite/Documents/GPadder-20260222T132711Z-1-001/GPadder/ExampleBlishhudModule/GamepadManager.cs)

- Add a method to enumerate USB devices using WMI (`Win32_PnPEntity` or `Win32_USBHub`).
- Log detailed device information including:
    - Name
    - DeviceID (contains VID/PID)
    - Status
    - Manufacturer (if available)
- Enhance MonoGame `Joystick.GetCapabilities` and `GamePad.GetCapabilities` logging to include more specific details about axes and buttons.
- Log these details at startup and whenever a device connection event is detected.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Run the BlishHUD module and check the updated [diagnostics.log](file:///c:/Users/syenite/Documents/GPadder-20260222T132711Z-1-001/GPadder/BlishHUD/gpadder-data/diagnostics.log).
- Verify that USB devices (even if not recognized as gamepads) are listed in the log.
- Verify that gamepad capabilities are logged in detail.
