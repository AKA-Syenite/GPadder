# AI Coding Best Practices & Pitfalls

## Best Practices
- **Pair Programmer Mindset**: Treat AI as a collaborator, not an autopilot. Always review and verify.
- **Incremental Generation**: Write and test small chunks of code rather than large blocks.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first to define the expected behavior for AI-generated code.
- **Context Management**: Provide clear, concise context to the AI for better results.
- **Security Check**: Never share sensitive credentials with AI tools.

## Common Pitfalls
- **"Almost Right" Syndrome**: AI producing code that looks correct but has subtle bugs.
- **Ghost Technical Debt**: Implementing complex AI-generated code that the human developer doesn't understand.
- **Outdated Dependencies**: AI suggesting deprecated libraries or vulnerable versions.
- **Performance Blindness**: Ignoring inefficient algorithms in AI-generated code.
- **Bias**: AI inheriting biases from its training data.
