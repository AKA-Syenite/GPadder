# BlishHUD Module Development

## Overview
Blish HUD is a C# overlay for Guild Wars 2 powered by MonoGame. It supports .NET modules that can extend its functionality.

## Module Lifecycle
Modules should override key methods in their `Module` class:
- `DefineSettings(SettingCollection settings)`: Define user-configurable settings.
- `Initialize()`: Perform initial setup before the module is loaded.
- `OnModuleLoaded(EventArgs e)`: Called when the module is fully loaded and ready.
- `Update(GameTime gameTime)`: Called every frame for logic updates.
- `Unload()`: Clean up resources.

## Best Practices
- **Stability**: Ensure the module handles errors gracefully to avoid crashing BlishHUD.
- **Resource Usage**: Be mindful of CPU and memory, especially in `Update`.
- **UI/UX**: Use the BlishHUD UI framework for consistency with GW2.

## Key APIs
- `GameService.Settings`: Manage persistence.
- `GameService.Graphics.SpriteScreen`: Root for UI controls.
- `GameService.Input`: Access keyboard, mouse, and game input.
- `GameService.Gw2Mumble`: Access Guild Wars 2 MumbleLink data.
